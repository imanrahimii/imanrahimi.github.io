title: Flagship Case Study – AI-Driven Decision Support System

# Flagship Case Study  
## AI-Driven Decision Support System for Complex Operational Planning

This case study presents a representative flagship project that illustrates my approach to **designing, developing, and deploying decision support systems (DSS)** that combine machine learning, optimisation, and domain knowledge to support real-world decision-making under uncertainty.

While specific datasets and organisational details remain confidential, the structure, methodology, and decision logic described here reflect real applied work across industrial and research-driven environments.

## 1. Problem Context

Organisations operating in complex environments often face decisions that are:
- High-dimensional and constrained  
- Subject to uncertainty and incomplete information  
- Characterised by competing objectives  
- Required to be made repeatedly over time  

In this project, the core challenge was to support **operational and strategic planning decisions** where traditional reporting or single-model approaches were insufficient. Decision-makers required a system that could:
- Integrate heterogeneous data sources  
- Evaluate multiple scenarios  
- Quantify trade-offs between alternatives  
- Produce outputs that were interpretable and defensible  

The problem could not be solved by a single predictive model or optimisation routine in isolation.

---

## 2. Decision-Centric Design Philosophy

The project followed a **decision-first design approach**, where analytical development was driven by the decisions to be supported, rather than by available models or data alone.

Key design questions included:
- What decisions must the system ultimately support?
- What information is available at the time of decision?
- What constraints are fixed versus flexible?
- How should uncertainty be represented and communicated?

This framing ensured that all analytical components were directly aligned with **decision relevance and operational usability**.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

The DSS was structured as a modular system with tightly integrated components:

### Data Layer
- Structured and semi-structured data ingestion  
- Data validation, cleaning, and transformation  
- Feature construction informed by domain logic  

### Analytics & Modelling Layer
- Predictive models to estimate key system behaviours  
- Scenario generation to reflect alternative assumptions  
- Quantification of uncertainty and variability  

### Optimisation & Decision Logic Layer
- Formulation of decision variables, objectives, and constraints  
- Evaluation of feasible decision alternatives  
- Trade-off analysis across competing performance criteria  

### Presentation & Interaction Layer
- Clear summaries of recommended decisions  
- Scenario comparison views  
- Sensitivity and “what-if” analysis outputs  

This layered design allowed flexibility, extensibility, and clear separation of responsibilities.

## 4. Machine Learning as an Enabler (Not the End Goal)

Machine learning models were used to **support decision-making**, not replace it.

Their role included:
- Predicting key quantities that influence decisions  
- Acting as surrogate models where direct evaluation was costly  
- Providing probabilistic or scenario-based inputs to downstream analysis  

Model selection prioritised:
- Stability and generalisation  
- Interpretability where required  
- Compatibility with optimisation and scenario analysis  

This ensured that ML outputs could be reliably embedded within decision workflows.

---

## 5. Optimisation and Trade-Off Analysis

Optimisation played a central role in exploring feasible decision alternatives under constraints.

Rather than producing a single “optimal” solution, the system was designed to:
- Explore multiple feasible solutions  
- Quantify trade-offs between objectives  
- Highlight sensitivity to key assumptions  

This allowed decision-makers to:
- Understand the structure of the decision space  
- Compare alternatives based on priorities  
- Make informed, transparent choices  

The emphasis was on **decision quality**, not mathematical optimality in isolation.

## 6. Scenario Analysis and Uncertainty Handling

Uncertainty was treated as a first-class design consideration.

The system enabled:
- Scenario-based evaluation under alternative assumptions  
- Comparison of decisions across plausible futures  
- Explicit communication of uncertainty and risk  

This approach supported robust decision-making, particularly in contexts where:
- Data quality varied  
- Future conditions were uncertain  
- Decisions carried long-term consequences  

---

## 7. Interpretability and Stakeholder Trust

A key success factor of the project was **stakeholder trust**.

To support this, the system emphasised:
- Clear explanation of model behaviour and assumptions  
- Transparent reporting of performance and limitations  
- Visual and narrative summaries aligned with decision-maker needs  

This ensured that recommendations were not treated as “black-box outputs”, but as analytically justified guidance.

---

## 8. Outcomes and Value Delivered

Although specific metrics are confidential, the project delivered value in several dimensions:

- Improved structure and clarity in complex decision processes  
- Enhanced ability to compare and justify alternative strategies  
- Greater confidence in planning and forecasting decisions  
- A reusable analytical framework adaptable to evolving requirements  

Importantly, the system shifted decision-making from ad-hoc judgement toward **evidence-based, scenario-aware reasoning**.

---

## 9. Key Lessons and Reflections

This project reinforced several important principles:

- Decision support systems must start from decisions, not models  
- Integration of ML and optimisation is most effective when modular  
- Interpretability and communication are as important as accuracy  
- Robustness and flexibility matter more than theoretical optimality  

These lessons continue to shape my approach to applied data science and decision intelligence.

## 10. Relevance and Transferability

While this case study reflects a specific application, the underlying methodology is transferable to:
- Energy system planning  
- Infrastructure and resource allocation  
- Operations and scheduling problems  
- Strategic analytics and policy support  

The approach is particularly suitable for organisations facing **complex decisions under uncertainty**, where analytical rigour must align with real-world constraints.

## Collaboration

I welcome discussion and collaboration on similar decision support challenges, including applied research projects, industry partnerships, and advanced analytics initiatives that require rigorous yet practical solutions.
