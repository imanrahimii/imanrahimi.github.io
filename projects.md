# Projects

This page highlights selected project areas and representative work that illustrate my experience in applying data science, machine learning, and optimisation to real-world decision-making problems. The emphasis is on **problem formulation, methodological rigor, and practical impact**, rather than purely theoretical experimentation.

## Decision Support Systems (DSS)

### AI-Driven Decision Support for Complex Operational Environments
Designed and contributed to decision support systems that integrate data analytics, machine learning, and optimisation to assist decision-makers operating under uncertainty, multiple objectives, and real-world constraints.

Key characteristics of this work include:
- Translating complex operational problems into structured decision models
- Combining predictive analytics with optimisation and rule-based logic
- Supporting scenario-based analysis to compare alternative strategies
- Ensuring outputs are interpretable and actionable for non-technical stakeholders

Applications include resource planning, operational scheduling, and strategic decision evaluation in complex environments where data is incomplete, uncertain, or evolving over time.

### Scenario Analysis and Decision Recommendation Frameworks
Developed scenario-based decision frameworks that allow stakeholders to:
- Explore trade-offs between competing objectives (e.g. cost, risk, performance)
- Evaluate “what-if” scenarios under different assumptions and constraints
- Understand sensitivity of decisions to changes in key input variables

These frameworks are designed to bridge the gap between analytical models and real-world decision processes, enabling informed, transparent, and defensible decision-making.

## Forecasting & Business Analytics

### Predictive Analytics for Planning and Performance Improvement
Built forecasting and predictive analytics workflows to support operational and strategic planning. This includes end-to-end pipelines covering data preparation, model development, evaluation, and result interpretation.

Core aspects include:
- Time-series forecasting and supervised learning for demand and performance prediction
- Feature engineering grounded in domain understanding
- Model evaluation aligned with business-relevant metrics rather than purely statistical accuracy

The focus is on producing forecasts that can be confidently used for planning and decision support, rather than isolated model performance.

### Explainable Models and Performance Reporting
Applied explainability and transparent evaluation techniques to ensure that predictive models can be trusted and understood by decision-makers.

This includes:
- Clear communication of model assumptions and limitations
- Performance reporting tailored to operational KPIs
- Interpretation of model outputs in the context of real business decisions

The goal is to ensure that analytics outputs directly inform action, rather than remaining as technical artefacts.

## Data Intelligence (Text Mining & Bibliometrics)

### Research and Technology Landscape Analysis
Applied text mining, network analysis, and bibliometric methods to analyse large collections of academic and technical documents. This work supports strategic insight into:
- Research trends and emerging topics
- Collaboration patterns and knowledge networks
- The evolution of technologies and methodologies over time

These analyses are used to inform research strategy, innovation planning, and evidence-based decision-making.

---

### Topic Modelling and Network-Based Insights
Developed analytical workflows that combine:
- Topic modelling to uncover latent themes in large text corpora
- Citation and collaboration network analysis to identify influential actors and research clusters
- Quantitative indicators to support qualitative interpretation

This work sits at the intersection of data science and strategic intelligence, enabling stakeholders to move beyond anecdotal evidence toward data-driven insight.

## Methodological Emphasis Across Projects

Across all projects, my approach is characterised by:
- Strong problem formulation grounded in real constraints
- Integration of machine learning, analytics, and optimisation
- Focus on interpretability, scalability, and practical deployment
- Clear communication of results to technical and non-technical audiences

Rather than isolated experiments, these projects reflect a **decision-centric mindset**, where analytics and models are designed to directly support real-world choices and outcomes.

## Ongoing and Future Work

Current and future project directions include:
- More tightly integrated ML–optimisation decision pipelines
- Enhanced scenario analysis for dynamic and uncertain environments
- Scalable analytics solutions that balance model sophistication with operational usability

I am open to collaboration on applied research projects, industry engagements, and joint initiatives that require rigorous analytics combined with practical decision support.
