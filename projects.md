## Overview

This page presents selected project areas and representative work illustrating my experience in applied data science, machine learning, optimisation, and decision intelligence.

Rather than listing tools or isolated experiments, the focus is on how analytical methods are designed, integrated, and operationalised to support real-world decision-making. Across projects, my role typically spans:

Problem formulation

Methodological and system design

Implementation and validation

Communication of results to technical and non-technical stakeholders

### Decision Support Systems (DSS)
AI-Driven Decision Support for Complex, Constrained Environments

I have designed and contributed to AI-driven decision support systems that assist decision-makers operating under uncertainty, multiple objectives, and real operational constraints. These systems integrate data analytics, machine learning, and optimisation into coherent decision workflows, rather than isolated models.

### Key aspects of this work include:

Translating loosely defined, real-world problems into structured decision models

Identifying decision variables, constraints, objectives, and uncertainty sources

Integrating predictive models with optimisation and rule-based logic

Ensuring outputs are interpretable, transparent, and usable by non-technical stakeholders

These systems support decisions related to planning, scheduling, prioritisation, and strategic evaluation, particularly in environments where trade-offs between performance, cost, risk, and feasibility must be carefully balanced.

### Forecasting & Business Analytics
Predictive Analytics for Planning and Operations

I have developed forecasting and analytics solutions designed to support resource planning, operational decision-making, and performance monitoring.

Representative activities include:

Design of predictive analytics pipelines aligned with operational and business KPIs

Development of forecasting models for short-, medium-, and long-term planning

Incorporation of uncertainty estimates and scenario analysis

Communication of model outputs through clear reports and visual dashboards

The emphasis in these projects is on decision usefulness, ensuring forecasts directly inform planning actions rather than remaining purely descriptive.

### Data Intelligence (Text Mining & Bibliometrics)
Data-Driven Insight from Unstructured Information

I have worked on data intelligence projects involving text mining, bibliometric analysis, and network-based exploration to extract insight from large volumes of unstructured information.

This work includes:

Trend analysis and topic modelling to identify emerging themes

Collaboration and citation network analysis

Research landscape mapping and evidence synthesis

Development of reproducible data pipelines and analytical workflows

These methods have been applied to research analysis, policy-relevant studies, and strategic intelligence tasks, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

### Cross-Cutting Methodology

Across all projects, a consistent methodological philosophy is applied:

Decision-centric design rather than model-centric development

Emphasis on scalability and robustness

Integration of machine learning, optimisation, and domain knowledge

Clear communication of assumptions, limitations, and trade-offs
