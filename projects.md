# Projects

This page presents selected project domains and representative work that illustrate my experience in **applied data science, machine learning, optimisation, and decision intelligence**. Rather than listing tools or isolated experiments, the focus is on **how analytical methods are designed, integrated, and operationalised** to support real-world decision-making.

Across projects, my role typically spans **problem formulation, methodological design, implementation, validation, and stakeholder communication**, ensuring that analytical outputs are both technically sound and decision-relevant.

## Decision Support Systems (DSS)

### AI-Driven Decision Support for Complex, Constrained Environments

I have designed and contributed to decision support systems (DSS) that assist decision-makers operating under **uncertainty, multiple objectives, and real operational constraints**. These systems integrate data analytics, machine learning, and optimisation into coherent decision workflows rather than isolated models.

Key aspects of this work include:
- Translating loosely defined, real-world problems into structured decision models  
- Identifying decision variables, constraints, objectives, and uncertainty sources  
- Integrating predictive models with optimisation and rule-based logic  
- Ensuring outputs are interpretable and usable by non-technical stakeholders  

These DSS solutions are intended to support **planning, scheduling, prioritisation, and strategic evaluation**, particularly in environments where decisions must balance competing criteria such as performance, cost, risk, and feasibility.

---

### Decision-Centric System Design

A defining feature of my DSS work is a **decision-first mindset**. Instead of starting from models, the design process begins with:
- What decisions need to be made?
- What information is available at decision time?
- What trade-offs must be understood?
- What constraints are non-negotiable?

Analytical components are then selected and engineered to directly support those decisions. This approach ensures that DSS outputs move beyond “insights” and directly inform **actionable recommendations**.

---

### Scenario Analysis, Trade-Off Exploration, and Sensitivity

Many of the DSS frameworks I have worked on include explicit scenario analysis capabilities, allowing users to:
- Explore alternative assumptions and operating conditions  
- Compare multiple decision options under identical constraints  
- Understand sensitivity of outcomes to changes in key parameters  

This is particularly important in high-stakes environments where decisions must be **transparent, defensible, and robust** rather than optimised for a single assumed future.

## Forecasting & Business Analytics

### Predictive Analytics for Operational and Strategic Planning

I have built and contributed to forecasting and predictive analytics workflows designed to support **real planning and operational processes**, not just offline model evaluation.

This work typically covers:
- Data exploration and preprocessing aligned with domain context  
- Feature engineering informed by operational drivers  
- Model development using appropriate statistical and machine learning techniques  
- Evaluation using metrics aligned with business and operational KPIs  

Rather than optimising purely for predictive accuracy, emphasis is placed on **stability, interpretability, and usability** of forecasts in downstream decision-making.

---

### Forecasts as Decision Inputs (Not Standalone Outputs)

In many projects, forecasts serve as **inputs to broader decision frameworks** rather than final outputs. This includes:
- Feeding forecasts into optimisation or scenario analysis modules  
- Assessing how forecast uncertainty propagates into decisions  
- Communicating confidence ranges and limitations clearly to stakeholders  

This approach ensures that forecasting models contribute meaningfully to decisions, rather than being treated as isolated technical artefacts.

---

### Explainability, Transparency, and Performance Communication

Across analytics projects, I place strong emphasis on:
- Clearly communicating model assumptions and limitations  
- Providing interpretable summaries of model behaviour  
- Reporting performance in ways that align with stakeholder priorities  

The objective is to build **trust in analytical systems**, particularly in environments where decisions have financial, operational, or reputational consequences.

## Data Intelligence (Text Mining, Bibliometrics & Knowledge Analytics)

### Research, Technology, and Knowledge Landscape Analysis

I have applied text mining, bibliometric analysis, and network-based methods to analyse large collections of academic, technical, and policy-related documents. This work supports strategic insight into:
- Emerging research and technology trends  
- Collaboration and influence networks  
- Evolution of methodologies and application domains  

Such analyses are used to inform **research strategy, innovation planning, and evidence-based decision-making**.

---

### Topic Modelling and Semantic Analysis

Using topic modelling and semantic analysis techniques, I have developed workflows to:
- Extract latent themes from large document corpora  
- Track how topics evolve over time  
- Identify convergence or fragmentation within research fields  

These methods help stakeholders move beyond anecdotal understanding toward **systematic, data-driven insight**.

---

### Network Analysis and Influence Mapping

By combining citation data, collaboration networks, and content analysis, I have supported:
- Identification of influential authors, institutions, and research clusters  
- Analysis of collaboration structures and knowledge flows  
- Strategic assessment of research positioning and opportunities  

This work sits at the intersection of **data science, strategic intelligence, and decision support**.

---

## Methodological Principles Across Projects

Across all project domains, my work is guided by several consistent principles:

- **Problem formulation before modelling**  
- **Integration over isolation** (models as components of decision systems)  
- **Interpretability and transparency** as first-class requirements  
- **Scalability and computational feasibility**  
- **Clear communication** to both technical and non-technical audiences  

These principles ensure that analytical solutions remain relevant, robust, and usable in real operational contexts.

---

## Outcomes, Impact, and Value Creation

While many projects involve confidential data or settings, the value delivered typically includes:
- Improved decision quality through structured trade-off analysis  
- Increased confidence in planning and forecasting processes  
- Better alignment between data-driven insights and operational realities  
- Transfer of analytical capability and decision frameworks to stakeholders  

The emphasis is consistently on **enabling better decisions**, rather than delivering isolated models.

---

## Ongoing and Future Directions

Current and future project directions include:
- Deeper integration of machine learning and optimisation within DSS frameworks  
- Enhanced scenario analysis for dynamic and uncertain environments  
- Scalable decision intelligence solutions suitable for production deployment  
- Continued focus on bridging advanced analytics with practical decision-making  

I am open to collaboration on applied research projects, industry engagements, and joint initiatives that require **rigorous analytics combined with real-world decision relevance**.
