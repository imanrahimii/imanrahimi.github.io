## Overview
I work as a Data Scientist and Decision Scientist specialising in the design, development, and deployment of machine learning– and optimisation-driven decision systems for real-world operational and strategic problems.

My industry focus goes beyond building predictive models in isolation. I design end-to-end analytical solutions that translate data, algorithms, and uncertainty into actionable decisions, ensuring that outputs are aligned with business objectives, operational constraints, and stakeholder needs.

Across industry engagements, my work consistently integrates:

Machine learning and deep learning for prediction, representation learning, and pattern discovery

Mathematical optimisation and decision science for prescriptive analytics and optimal decision-making

Scalable and deployable system design, bridging prototypes and production environments

This hybrid perspective allows me to deliver solutions that are not only accurate, but usable, explainable, and operationally robust.

## Core Industry Expertise
## Optimisation-Driven Decision Making

A central pillar of my industry work is the application of optimisation techniques to complex decision problems involving competing objectives, uncertainty, and operational constraints.

I have applied optimisation methodologies to:

Resource allocation and scheduling

Planning under uncertainty and risk

Trade-off analysis across cost, performance, reliability, and feasibility

Large-scale, high-dimensional decision spaces

My optimisation toolkit includes:

Linear, nonlinear, integer, and mixed-integer programming

Multi-objective optimisation and Pareto-based decision analysis

Constraint handling techniques for infeasible or noisy real-world data

Metaheuristics and hybrid optimisation strategies for large-scale problems

Rather than treating optimisation as a purely mathematical exercise, I embed it within decision workflows, ensuring that optimisation outputs directly support planning, prioritisation, and policy decisions.


## Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics in Industry

In parallel, I design and deliver machine learning and deep learning models that support forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and representation learning across operational datasets.

My industry-facing ML work focuses on:

Time series forecasting for planning and demand estimation

Supervised and unsupervised learning for pattern discovery and segmentation

Deep learning models for complex, non-linear systems

Feature engineering and data representation for decision relevance

Importantly, my models are built with deployment and decision impact in mind, not just predictive accuracy. This includes:

Robust validation under real-world data limitations

Explainability and interpretability for non-technical stakeholders

Alignment with downstream optimisation or rule-based decision logic

## Integrated ML–Optimisation Systems
A defining feature of my industry profile is the integration of machine learning with optimisation and decision intelligence, forming coherent, end-to-end systems.

Rather than separating “prediction” and “decision”, I design systems where:

Machine learning models generate forecasts, risk estimates, or latent representations

Optimisation models consume these outputs to recommend actions

Decisions are evaluated across multiple scenarios and constraints

Results are communicated through interpretable analytics and dashboards

This integration enables:

Adaptive decision-making under uncertainty

Scenario-based planning and stress testing

Transparent trade-off analysis

Greater trust and adoption by business stakeholders

## What I Deliver
Across industry projects, I typically deliver:

Decision intelligence systems for operational and strategic planning

Predictive analytics pipelines aligned with business KPIs

Optimisation-based recommendation engines under real-world constraints

Scenario analysis and “what-if” decision tools

Explainable and governance-ready analytics for executive and regulatory contexts

Prototypes-to-production handover, including documentation and validation

My role often spans the full lifecycle:
problem framing → data analysis → modelling → validation → deployment support → stakeholder communication.

## Deployment, MLOps & Practical Delivery
I place strong emphasis on practical delivery and sustainability of analytical solutions.

This includes experience with:

Model validation, monitoring, and performance reporting

Reproducible pipelines and experiment tracking

Documentation for handover to engineering or analytics teams

Translating technical results into decision-ready insights

I work closely with domain experts, engineers, and decision-makers to ensure that analytical systems:

Fit existing workflows

Respect operational realities

Can be maintained and evolved over time
## Industry Domains & Applications
My industry experience spans a range of application domains, including:

Energy systems and infrastructure planning

Mining and large-scale industrial operations

Supply chain and logistics optimisation

Business analytics and performance forecasting

Decision support for complex socio-technical systems

Across these domains, my focus remains consistent:
turning data and models into reliable, defensible decisions.
