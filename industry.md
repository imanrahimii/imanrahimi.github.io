## Overview

I work as a Data Scientist, Decision Scientist, and Optimisation Specialist, building end-to-end decision systems that translate data, models, and uncertainty into actionable plans—across manufacturing, energy, and mining contexts. My industry focus is not “models in isolation”, but deployable decision workflows that fit real operational constraints (data limitations, capacity bottlenecks, lead times, and cross-functional dependencies).

## Industry Experience

### 1) Manufacturing — Production Planning & Scheduling (Automotive)

**Role:** Production Planning Analyst | **2017–2021** (large-scale automotive manufacturing environment), Iran

**What I did (high-impact planning work):**
- Owned **daily and weekly production schedules** for manufacturing lines, translating demand and constraints into feasible plans.
- Managed **capacity planning** (labour/machines/line availability) and continuously re-optimised schedules to reduce delays.
- Coordinated planning actions across **procurement, logistics, quality, and production** to maintain flow and delivery reliability.
- Maintained robust **WIP tracking**, production records, and order visibility to support control decisions and escalation.
- Supported **continuous improvement** in planning logic and operational coordination (reducing rework loops and schedule churn).

**How I think about it:**
- Production planning is a constrained optimisation problem: capacity, precedence, availability, and service-level trade-offs.
- I prioritise feasibility-first scheduling, then improve performance via bottleneck management and scenario-based replanning.

### 2) Manufacturing — High-Volume Food Production Planning

**Role:** Production Planning Analyst| **2013–2016** (high-volume food manufacturing environment), Malaysia

**What I did (operations + coordination):**
- Supported **production planning and scheduling** across processing and packaging lines under tight time and quality constraints.
- Coordinated across **processing, packaging, and logistics**, aligning material availability with throughput targets.
- Tracked **materials availability, output, and daily variances**, supporting corrective actions and short-cycle replanning.
- Contributed to reporting and efficiency improvement initiatives (reducing shortages, improving visibility, stabilising handovers).

**Why this matters for decision science:**
- Food manufacturing is a “real-time” system: variability, constraints, and compliance requirements make robust planning essential.
- This experience strengthened my ability to operate with incomplete information and still deliver stable plans.

### 3) Applied Industry Research — Energy & Mining Decision Support

**Focus:** Applied research projects supporting operational decision-making in energy and mining (Australia)
**What I deliver (industry-facing outcomes):**
- Turning operational and production data into **decision support models** for planning, prioritisation, and trade-off evaluation.
- Developing optimisation studies and analytical prototypes with stakeholders, focusing on practicality and operational relevance.
- Building frameworks that integrate **predictive analytics + optimisation** for decisions under uncertainty.

## Capability Stack (How I Deliver in Industry)

### A) Optimisation-Driven Decision Making
I build prescriptive systems for decisions involving competing objectives and real constraints, including:
- Resource allocation and scheduling under limited capacity
- Planning under uncertainty and operational risk
- Multi-objective trade-offs (cost, performance, reliability, feasibility)
- Constraint-handling when data is noisy, incomplete, or operational rules are complex

### B) Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics (Deployment-Oriented)
My ML work is designed to serve downstream decisions, not just accuracy:
- Forecasting and predictive modelling to inform planning actions
- Feature engineering and representation learning for decision relevance
- Robust validation under real-world data limitations
- Explainability and stakeholder-ready reporting

### C) Integrated ML–Optimisation Systems (End-to-End Delivery)
A defining feature of my industry approach is integration:
- ML models generate forecasts / risk estimates / latent signals
- Optimisation consumes these signals to recommend feasible actions
- Outputs are stress-tested via scenarios and constraints
- Results are communicated through interpretable summaries and decision dashboards

## How I Work (Practical Delivery Style)
- Decision-centric design (start from what must be decided, not from the model)
- Feasibility-first modelling (plans must work in real constraints)
- Scenario-aware analysis (plan robustness matters more than idealised optimality)
- Clear communication (assumptions, limitations, and trade-offs are explicit)
