## Overview
I am a senior Data Scientist and Decision Scientist specialising in the design and delivery of machine learning-, optimisation-, and analytics-driven decision systems for complex operational and strategic problems.

My industry-oriented work focuses on turning data, models, and algorithms into deployable decision tools, rather than isolated analyses or academic prototypes. I work across the full analytics lifecycle — from problem formulation and data modelling to optimisation, validation, and stakeholder-ready delivery.

A defining feature of my approach is a decision-first mindset: analytical methods are selected and designed based on the decisions they are intended to support, the constraints under which those decisions are made, and the organisational context in which they are deployed.

## What I Deliver
Decision intelligence for operational and strategic planning
Translating business and operational questions into formal decision frameworks supported by analytics and optimisation.

End-to-end machine learning solutions
Designing pipelines that span data preparation, feature engineering, model development, validation, and deployment.

Predictive analytics and forecasting
Development of forecasting systems aligned with business KPIs, including uncertainty quantification and scenario-based analysis.

Optimisation-driven recommendations
Integration of optimisation methods with predictive models to generate actionable recommendations under real-world constraints.

Explainability and governance-ready outputs
Ensuring models and recommendations are interpretable, auditable, and suitable for executive, regulatory, and operational stakeholders.

Production-oriented delivery
Supporting the transition from research and prototyping to operational deployment, including documentation and handover.
## Industry Application Areas
My applied work spans a range of data-intensive and decision-critical domains, including:

Energy systems and renewables
Forecasting, planning, and optimisation under uncertainty.

Mining and resource optimisation
Large-scale scheduling, planning, and decision support under complex constraints.

Industrial and manufacturing systems
Data-driven planning, optimisation, and performance analysis.

Enterprise decision systems
Analytics and optimisation supporting planning, prioritisation, and strategic evaluation.

Across these domains, the emphasis remains on robust, scalable, and decision-relevant solutions rather than purely predictive performance.
