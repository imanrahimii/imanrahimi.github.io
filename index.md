### Data Scientist | Decision Scientist | Machine Learning & Optimization Specialist

I am a senior Data Scientist and Decision Scientist working at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and large-scale decision support systems. My work spans both academic research and industry-focused delivery, with a strong emphasis on building models and algorithms that are not only theoretically sound, but also scalable, interpretable, and deployable in real operational environments.

I bring a unique hybrid background, holding PhD in Computer Science from the University of Technology Sydney, alongside extensive hands-on experience in applied machine learning, optimization engineering, and high-performance computing. This combination allows me to translate advanced analytical and optimization techniques into practical decision-making tools for complex, data-intensive systems in energy, mining, infrastructure, and industrial operations.

From an academic perspective, my research focuses on multi-objective optimization, deep learning, evolutionary algorithms, and hybrid machine learning–optimization frameworks. I have published widely in high-impact international journals, accumulated over 1300 citations, and actively contribute to the research community as a reviewer and collaborator. My academic work is strongly application-driven, with a consistent focus on real-world constraints, scalability, and decision relevance.

From an industry perspective, I specialise in designing and implementing end-to-end decision intelligence solutions. This includes developing machine learning pipelines, optimisation engines, and decision support systems that operate under uncertainty, large search spaces, and strict computational constraints. I have worked extensively with large-scale optimisation problems where classical methods alone are insufficient, requiring hybrid approaches that combine predictive models, heuristics, exact methods, and high-performance computing.

## Professional Focus & Core Capabilities

My work sits at the practical boundary between data science, optimisation engineering, and decision analytics. Key areas of expertise include:

- Applied machine learning and predictive modelling for operational decision-making  
- Decision Support Systems (DSS) for complex, multi-criteria environments  
- Large-scale, multi-objective, and constrained optimisation  
- Evolutionary and metaheuristic algorithms for real-world optimisation problems  
- GPU-accelerated and parallel computing (CUDA, HPC, AVX-based workflows)  
- Energy system modelling, forecasting, and optimisation  
- Mining and resource optimisation, including long-term scheduling under uncertainty  
- Scalable ML systems, MLOps, and production-oriented analytics pipelines  

I am particularly interested in problems where decisions must be made under uncertainty, competing objectives, and limited computational budgets, and where analytical rigour must be balanced with operational feasibility.

## Selected Applied Research & Industry Projects

**Large-Scale Decision Support for Open-Pit Mining**  
Design and development of decision support systems for long-term open-pit mine scheduling under geological uncertainty. This work integrates evolutionary optimisation, decomposition techniques, and GPU-accelerated computation to handle extremely large problem sizes while maintaining solution quality and feasibility. The focus is on generating actionable schedules that can be used in real planning environments rather than purely theoretical benchmarks.

**GPU-Accelerated Optimisation and High-Performance Algorithms**  
Development of performance-critical optimisation and numerical algorithms using GPU and parallel architectures. This includes optimising memory access patterns, numerical stability, and computational throughput for large-scale optimisation and analytical workloads, with direct relevance to time-sensitive industrial decision processes.

**Energy Systems Analytics and Optimisation**  
Application of machine learning, surrogate modelling, and multi-objective optimisation to energy forecasting, planning, and sustainability-related decision problems. This work supports decision-makers in evaluating trade-offs between cost, reliability, emissions, and operational constraints.

**Hybrid ML–Optimisation Frameworks for Decision Intelligence**  
Design of integrated frameworks that combine predictive models (e.g., forecasting, surrogate models) with optimisation engines to enable adaptive, data-driven decision-making. These frameworks are designed to operate in dynamic environments where data evolves over time and decisions must be updated continuously.

## Publications, Impact & Knowledge Transfer

I have authored and co-authored numerous peer-reviewed publications in optimisation, machine learning, and applied decision sciences, with over **1300 citations** to date. My research is published in well-regarded international journals and conferences, and is frequently motivated by industrial and applied challenges rather than purely theoretical considerations.

Beyond publications, I place strong emphasis on knowledge transfer, ensuring that research outputs can be translated into tools, frameworks, and methodologies that are usable by practitioners, analysts, and decision-makers.

## Industry Engagement & Collaboration

I actively collaborate with industry partners to design and implement data-driven decision support solutions that align with operational needs and strategic objectives. I am particularly interested in projects where advanced analytics and optimisation can deliver measurable improvements in efficiency, robustness, or sustainability.

I am open to:
- Applied research collaborations and joint funding proposals  
- Industry partnerships and consulting engagements  
- Visiting academic and research appointments  
- Senior and principal-level roles in data science and decision intelligence  

My work is best suited to organisations and research groups that value analytical depth, scalable computation, and the practical integration of machine learning and optimisation into decision-making processes.
