## Overview

I am an academic researcher with a multidisciplinary background in Industrial Engineering and Computer Science, specialising in data-driven optimisation, machine learning, deep learning, and decision support systems. My research is strongly application-driven, focusing on developing advanced analytical and optimisation methods that can be deployed in large-scale, real-world decision environments.

My work lies at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, optimisation, and decision science, with a particular emphasis on problems characterised by uncertainty, complex constraints, and high computational scale. I aim to bridge rigorous methodological development with practical decision impact, ensuring that research outputs are both theoretically sound and operationally relevant.

## Research Focus: Machine Learning & Deep Learning

A central component of my research is the integration of machine learning and deep learning models with optimisation and decision frameworks. Rather than treating ML models as standalone predictors, my work focuses on embedding learning models within decision-making pipelines, enabling adaptive, data-informed decisions.

## Key research directions include:

Machine learning for decision support
Use of supervised and ensemble learning (e.g. tree-based models, gradient boosting) to model complex system behaviour and inform optimisation processes.

Deep learning for large-scale and complex systems
Application of deep neural networks for representation learning, surrogate modelling, and high-dimensional pattern extraction in data-intensive domains.

Hybrid ML–optimisation frameworks
Coupling predictive models with optimisation engines to support planning, scheduling, and resource allocation under uncertainty.

Scalable and interpretable AI
Emphasis on explainability, robustness, and scalability to ensure models are suitable for real-world deployment and stakeholder use.

These methods are applied across domains such as energy systems, mining optimisation, industrial operations, and infrastructure planning.
