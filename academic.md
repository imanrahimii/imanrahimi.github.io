# Academic Profile

## Overview
I am an academic researcher with a multidisciplinary background in Industrial Engineering and Computer Science, specialising in data-driven optimisation, machine learning, deep learning, and decision support systems. My research is strongly application-driven, focusing on developing advanced analytical and optimisation methods that can be deployed in large-scale, real-world decision environments.

My work lies at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, optimisation, and decision science, with a particular emphasis on problems characterised by uncertainty, complex constraints, and high computational scale. I aim to bridge rigorous methodological development with practical decision impact—ensuring that research outputs are both theoretically sound and operationally relevant.

## Research Focus: Machine Learning & Deep Learning
A central component of my research is the integration of machine learning and deep learning models with optimisation and decision frameworks. Rather than treating ML models as standalone predictors, my work focuses on embedding learning models within decision-making pipelines, enabling adaptive, data-informed decisions.

Key directions include:
- **Hybrid learning–optimisation systems** where predictive models are coupled with constrained optimisation for planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.
- **Deep learning for complex decision environments**, including representation learning, surrogate modelling, and learning-based decision policies.
- **Scalable, high-performance decision support**, leveraging GPU/HPC acceleration for computationally intensive optimisation and real-time decision workflows.

## Research Themes
My academic work spans several interlinked themes:

### 1) Data-driven Optimisation & Multi-objective Decision-making
- Multi-objective optimisation for large-scale, real-world systems  
- Decision modelling under competing objectives (cost, risk, feasibility, performance)  
- Constraint-aware optimisation and feasibility-first strategies  

### 2) Decision Support Systems (DSS) under Uncertainty
- Decision support for complex environments with operational constraints  
- Scenario-based analysis and uncertainty-aware planning  
- Deployable decision pipelines: data → model → decision recommendation  

### 3) High-Performance Computing (HPC) for ML + Optimisation
- GPU acceleration and parallel computing to scale decision pipelines  
- Algorithm engineering for large data + optimisation workloads  
- Performance benchmarking and reproducible computational workflows  

### 4) AI for Energy, Mining, and Industrial Systems
- Applied AI and optimisation in energy systems and industrial operations  
- Forecasting, efficiency optimisation, and decision analytics  
- Industry-relevant, decision-centric modelling
